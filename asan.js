// The page that this script is loaded into is called the 'destination'.
// Which is shortened to "dst" in the code.
//
// Elsewhere, at a different path, there is a 'source'.
// Which is shortern to "src" in the code.
//
// The 'dst' has a path. For example, it might be:
//
//	/topic/apple/banana/cherry
//
// The page of the 'src' is based on the path of the 'dst'.
// For the example 'dst' path the corresponding 'src' path is:
//
//	/src/topic/apple/banana/cherry
//
// I.e., the corresponding 'src' path has a "/src" prefix.
//
// This JavaScript code looks at the path of the 'dst' and calculates the path of the 'src'.
// It then fetches the HTML from the 'src' path.
// It then includes the HTML it fetched from the 'src' path here into the 'dst'.
// It then sets the title of the page to the inner-text for the first <h1> from the 'src'.
